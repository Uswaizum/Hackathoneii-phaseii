# Tasks: Backend Core – Task Management API

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/backend-task-api/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create backend folder structure per implementation plan
- [x] T002 Initialize FastAPI project with required dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Create CLAUDE.md backend instructions file
- [x] T004 [P] Configure environment-based settings in backend/config/settings.py

---
## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [x] T005 Configure DATABASE_URL from environment in backend/config/settings.py
- [x] T006 [P] Initialize SQLModel engine and session in backend/database/database.py
- [x] T007 [P] Implement database connection layer with automatic table creation
- [x] T008 Create Task model per data model specification in backend/models/task_model.py
- [x] T009 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [x] T010 Setup validation schemas for API requests/responses in backend/schemas/task_schemas.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create Tasks (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to create new tasks in their personal task list with title, description, and completion status tracking

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tasks and verifying they persist in the database and can be retrieved.

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Contract test for POST /api/{user_id}/tasks in backend/tests/contract/test_task_creation.py
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Integration test for task creation user journey in backend/tests/integration/test_task_creation.py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T013 [P] [US1] Create Task model with required fields in backend/models/task_model.py
- [x] T014 [P] [US1] Create TaskCreate schema in backend/schemas/task_schemas.py
- [x] T015 [US1] Implement Task service for creation in backend/api/task_routes.py
- [x] T016 [US1] Implement POST /api/{user_id}/tasks endpoint in backend/api/task_routes.py
- [x] T017 [US1] Add validation and error handling for task creation
- [x] T018 [US1] Add logging for task creation operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - View Tasks (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Allow users to view all their tasks, including filtering by completion status and viewing individual task details

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tasks and retrieving them via the API endpoints.

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [x] T019 [P] [US2] Contract test for GET /api/{user_id}/tasks in backend/tests/contract/test_task_retrieval.py
- [x] T020 [P] [US2] Contract test for GET /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id} in backend/tests/contract/test_task_detail.py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T021 [P] [US2] Create TaskResponse schema in backend/schemas/task_schemas.py
- [x] T022 [US2] Implement Task service for retrieval in backend/api/task_routes.py
- [x] T023 [US2] Implement GET /api/{user_id}/tasks endpoint in backend/api/task_routes.py
- [x] T024 [US2] Implement GET /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id} endpoint in backend/api/task_routes.py
- [x] T025 [US2] Add filtering capability for task retrieval
- [x] T026 [US2] Add validation and error handling for task retrieval

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Update Task Status (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to mark tasks as completed or uncompleted to track their progress

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by updating task completion status and verifying the change persists.

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [x] T027 [P] [US3] Contract test for PUT /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id} in backend/tests/contract/test_task_update.py
- [x] T028 [P] [US3] Contract test for PATCH /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}/complete in backend/tests/contract/test_task_completion.py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T029 [P] [US3] Create TaskUpdate schema in backend/schemas/task_schemas.py
- [x] T030 [US3] Implement Task service for updates in backend/api/task_routes.py
- [x] T031 [US3] Implement PUT /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id} endpoint in backend/api/task_routes.py
- [x] T032 [US3] Implement PATCH /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}/complete endpoint in backend/api/task_routes.py
- [x] T033 [US3] Implement DELETE /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id} endpoint in backend/api/task_routes.py
- [x] T034 [US3] Add validation and error handling for task updates

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T035 [P] Documentation updates in backend/README.md
- [x] T036 Code cleanup and refactoring
- [x] T037 Performance optimization across all stories
- [x] T038 [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in backend/tests/unit/
- [x] T039 Security hardening to prevent cross-user access
- [x] T040 Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for POST /api/{user_id}/tasks in backend/tests/contract/test_task_creation.py"
Task: "Integration test for task creation user journey in backend/tests/integration/test_task_creation.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Task model with required fields in backend/models/task_model.py"
Task: "Create TaskCreate schema in backend/schemas/task_schemas.py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
